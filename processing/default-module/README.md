# QSM Processing Module

This default implementation processes the QSM using a combination of HD-BET and QSM-XT.

The results are then aligned to the FGATIR image and converted into DICOMS.

It requires T1, FGATIR, and QSM dicoms.

First install it by calling `./install.sh`.

To run, call `./main.sh`. Read that script for correct arguments.
